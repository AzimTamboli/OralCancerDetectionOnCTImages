## Oral Cancer Detection on CT images

This repository contains C++ implementation of oral cancer detection method described in the paper ["Computer Aided Detection of Oral Lesions on CT Images"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09769)

There are two ways to test the algorithm developed for CT images: 

A. By running the stand-alone executable file. 

B. By running the code in visual studio environment. 

These two methods are explained in readme.pdf file.


## Requirements

Windows 7

Visual Studio 2010

OpenCV 2.4.9

## Usage
